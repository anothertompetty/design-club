<span class="text-heavy">This is a rare opportunity to truly shape the direction of a product that real people really love. We think Personably offers an exciting design challenge, with the option to get stuck in to the nitty gritty of building a business if you like. Perfect for someone looking to have more ownership over their work, or to make the leap into the world of startups. &mdash; *Team DC*</span>
<br><br>
### DC: What’s your ambition for the business?
At Personably, we’re building tools to help teams deliver an outstanding employee
experience. With a background in fast-growing start-ups, we’ve seen how difficult it can be
to ensure everyone gets the opportunity to thrive from day one.<br><br>

Our focus right now is on making each hire’s onboarding period the best it can possibly
be. That means building easy-to-use, intuitive, and beautiful tools. Early on, we’ve worked
with the kinds of teams we know best &mdash; fast-growing, well-funded tech start-ups. But our
vision goes beyond that &mdash; we want to improve the world of work for the majority, from
small start-ups to big corporates. Help us get there.

<br><br>
### DC: Why should someone care?
Everyone we speak to has their own story about something that went wrong in their first
week that has stuck with them. It's not just start-ups either &mdash; banks, the government,
national retailers. If you’re hiring ambitious individuals ensuring they can be productive
and deliver value is the key to retention.

<br><br>
### DC: What would a typical day for a designer look like?
Two days are rarely the same, and you’ll often be expected to step outside of your comfort
zone.<br><br>

As a product designer, we want Personably to be a place you can develop your skills, try
new tools and create products that exceed users’ expectations.<br><br>

An example task you might work on include overhauling the flow of the product to make it
easy to use the ever increasing functionality &mdash; as the product develops it becomes
increasingly important to maintain the simplicity our users love while introducing the
features they need.<br><br>

But don’t be surprised if you get pulled away by the CEO to give your opinion on a new
pricing model, find yourself pitching in to help with a community event we’ve organised,
or helping our customers through our support chat.

<br><br>
### DC: Who does well in your company?
Early stage start-ups are hard work, but they can be hugely rewarding places to work.<br><br>

You’ll need to be comfortable with uncertainty, taking full ownership of the design and
making decisions without all the information. We asks our customers and ship things to
test our assumptions and improve them, instead of dealing with hypotheticals and a big
reveal at the end.<br><br>

You need empathy for the people we’re building for and the problem we’re solving for
them. Talking to them will inform your design decisions. You strive to make products that
are intuitive to use and understand this sometimes means sacrificing what looks
aesthetically best.<br><br>

You can balance the need to create something perfect with the speed and resources of an
early stage start-up.<br><br>

We’re a small team and you’ll have a big impact!<br><br>

This would be a great opportunity for someone with experience at a growing start-up or
large tech company, looking to make a mark and have full ownership of design across the
brand and product as the first designer at an exciting start-up.
