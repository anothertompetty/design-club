<span class="text-heavy">GoCardless are old friends of ours. In fact, two of our founders have worked there! It's how we know that this is a great opportunity. We think it's ideal for someone who wants to focus on the complex UX challenges around APIs, integrations, and forms. It's a chance to work with truly world class designers, developers, and product people, in a supportive and fast-growing environment. &mdash; *Team DC*</span>
<br><br>

### DC: What’s your ambition for the business?
Our ambition is to build a new global network for recurring payments. We're linking together payment schemes from around the world to create a simple way of collecting payments directly from customers' bank accounts.

<br><br>
### DC: Why should someone care?
Our software empowers businesses of all sizes to take reoccurring payments from their customer in a way that is cheaper, more sustainable and more efficient than traditional methods, while creating a better experience for the end-customer also.<br><br>

We've established ourselves firmly in the UK market, and are now adding more and more countries to our platform every day. There has never been a more exciting time to join us as we expand our payments network across the globe.<br><br>

Lastly, we foster and care deeply about our company culture that champions integrity and humility, and ensures that whatever we do we do it the right way.

<br><br>
### DC: What would a typical day look like?
A typical usually starts &mdash; after you've applied the finishing touches to your latte art on your coffee from our fancy new machine &mdash; with a stand up with the rest of your cross-functional, agile team.<br><br>

Then the rest of your day depends on you, your process and the project you're working. Whether you're meeting customers, analysing research, creating wireframes or crafting final designs, you'll be given full autonomy to identify and solve problems as you see fit.<br><br>

If you need support, it's there. We have a growing team of Product Designers who are always ready and willing to bounce ideas off, critique work and even pair on projects when needed.

<br><br>
### DC: Who does well in your company?
The challenges that you'll face at GoCardless are complex and on a global scale. So you need to be the type of person that likes geeking out on payment networks, schemes and all things fintech.<br><br>

GoCardless is also now quite a large company, so good communication skills are essential to share concepts, context and your work across not just the product team but the many stakeholders across the company.<br><br>

Lastly, you gotta be a nice person. We care deeply about company culture here and have some core company values that essentially all point toward the same thing — be a good person.
